### üí° **PowerShell Pro Tips**

#### **Navigate to Your Scripts Folder**
Once PowerShell terminal opens, you need to change directory to where your installation scripts are located:
```powershell
cd C:\WSL-Scripts
```

#### **Tab Completion (Auto-Complete)**
PowerShell has smart auto-completion! Type the first few characters of a filename and press **TAB** to auto-complete:
- Type `1` + **TAB** ‚Üí PowerShell completes to `1-install-wsl.ps1`
- Type `3-i` + **TAB** ‚Üí PowerShell completes to `3-install-podman.ps1`
- Press **TAB** multiple times to cycle through matching files

#### **Command History Navigation**
PowerShell remembers your previous commands:
- Press **‚Üë (Up Arrow)** to recall the last command
- Keep pressing **‚Üë** to browse through command history
- Press **‚Üì (Down Arrow)** to go forward in history
- Press **Enter** to execute the selected command

#### **Quick Script Execution**
```powershell
# Navigate to folder
cd C:\WSL-Scripts

# Run scripts in order (use Tab completion!)
.\1-install-wsl.ps1
# (Restart computer, then continue)
.\2-post-install-wsl.ps1
.\3-install-podman.ps1
# (Close PowerShell, open new one)
.\4-post-install-podman.ps1
```

## üìñ Detailed Usage Instructions

### Script Execution Policies

If you encounter execution policy errors, temporarily allow script execution:

```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Temporarily allow local scripts (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# After installation, restore original policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WSL Detection Behavior

#### WSL Already Installed

**Scenario**: The installation script detects an existing WSL installation
**Behavior**:

- Script displays current WSL version information
- Prompts user with "Do you want to continue anyway? (Y/N)"
- **Y/Yes**: Continues with installation (useful for repairs, updates, or feature re-enablement)
- **N/No**: Safely exits without making changes

**When to Continue**:

- WSL features are partially installed or corrupted
- You want to ensure all required Windows features are properly enabled
- Performing maintenance or troubleshooting existing WSL installation

**When to Cancel**:

- WSL is working perfectly and no changes are needed
- You ran the script by mistake

### Common Issues

#### Administrator Permission Errors

**Problem**: Script fails with Administrator requirement messages
**Examples**:

```
The script cannot be run because it contains a "#requires" statement for running as Administrator
```

```
ERROR: This script must be run as Administrator!
```

**Solution**: See the complete [Running PowerShell as Administrator](#-running-powershell-as-administrator) section above for detailed instructions with visual guides.

#### "git is not recognized" Error

**Problem**: Git is not installed or not in PATH
**Solutions**:

1. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Restart PowerShell** after Git installation
3. **Alternative**: Download ZIP directly from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract

#### "Script cannot be loaded" Error

**Problem**: PowerShell execution policy blocks script
**Solution**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### "Insufficient RAM" Error

**Problem**: System has less than 6GB RAM
**Solution**:

- üí° It's the right moment to request a new computer! üòÑ
- (Or you could try closing some memory-intensive applications, but where's the fun in that?)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix for Common WSL Errors

If you encounter errors like "WSL is not installed or not accessible" or Windows prompts to install WSL when running scripts:

### Most Likely Causes:

1. **Wrong Script Order** (Most Common)

   - Running `2-post-install-wsl.ps1` without running `1-install-wsl.ps1` first
   - **Solution**: Always follow the correct order: `1-install-wsl.ps1` ‚Üí Restart ‚Üí `2-post-install-wsl.ps1` ‚Üí `3-install-podman.ps1` ‚Üí `4-post-install-podman.ps1`
2. **Missing Restart**

   - Ran `1-install-wsl.ps1` but didn't restart the computer
   - **Solution**: Restart the computer and then run `2-post-install-wsl.ps1`
3. **Administrator Privileges**

   - Scripts not running with Administrator privileges
   - **Solution**: Right-click PowerShell ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

### Diagnostic Steps:

1. **Check if WSL features are enabled:**

   ```powershell
   Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
   Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform
   ```
2. **If features show "Disabled":**

   - Run `.\1-install-wsl.ps1` as Administrator
   - Restart when prompted
3. **If features show "Enabled" but WSL still doesn't work:**

   - Restart the computer
   - Then run `.\2-post-install-wsl.ps1`

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Always run scripts as Administrator
- Ensure system restart after initial installation
- Keep Windows and WSL updated for best performance
- Review script contents before execution for security
