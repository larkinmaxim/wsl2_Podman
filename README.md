## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Folder and Clone Repository
1. **Create a folder for scripts**
   ```powershell
   # Create folder on Desktop (or anywhere you prefer)
   mkdir C:\WSL-Scripts
   cd C:\WSL-Scripts
   ```

2. **Open terminal in this folder and clone repository**
   ```powershell
   git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman.git .
   ```

### Step 2: Run WSL Installation
1. **Close terminal and run Terminal as Administrator**
   ```powershell
   # Right-click Start ‚Üí Windows Terminal (Admin)
   ```

2. **Navigate to scripts folder**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\WSL-Scripts
   ```

3. **Run WSL installation script**
   ```powershell
   .\install-wsl.ps1
   ```

### Step 3: Restart Computer
**Restart your computer when prompted**

### Step 4: Complete Installation
1. **Run Terminal as Administrator again**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\WSL-Scripts
   ```

2. **Run post-installation script**
   ```powershell
   .\post-install-wsl.ps1
   ```

3. **Run Podman installation script**
   ```powershell
   .\install-podman.ps1
   ```

**‚úÖ Done! Your WSL2 and Podman environment is ready.**

## üìñ Detailed Usage Instructions

### Script Execution Policies

If you encounter execution policy errors, temporarily allow script execution:

```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Temporarily allow local scripts (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# After installation, restore original policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Analysis & Validation

### install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths**:

- Detects existing WSL installations and provides user choice
- Comprehensive system checks before installation
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- User-friendly colored output
- Safe restart handling with confirmation
- Follows PowerShell best practices

**‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations**:

- RAM requirement (6GB) might be restrictive for some users
- No CPU virtualization capability check

### post-install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths**:

- Thorough WSL installation verification
- Informative status reporting
- Helpful guidance for next steps
- Robust error handling
- Automatic WSL updates

### install-podman.ps1 Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths**:

- Smart WSL dependency checking before installation
- Dynamic download from official GitHub releases API
- Silent installation with comprehensive progress feedback
- Automatic machine initialization and startup
- Thorough verification including test container execution
- Excellent error handling with troubleshooting guidance
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

**‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations**:

- Requires stable internet connection for downloads
- Downloads and executes binary from internet (from official source)
- Podman machine startup can take several minutes on first run

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WSL Detection Behavior

#### WSL Already Installed

**Scenario**: The installation script detects an existing WSL installation
**Behavior**:

- Script displays current WSL version information
- Prompts user with "Do you want to continue anyway? (Y/N)"
- **Y/Yes**: Continues with installation (useful for repairs, updates, or feature re-enablement)
- **N/No**: Safely exits without making changes

**When to Continue**:

- WSL features are partially installed or corrupted
- You want to ensure all required Windows features are properly enabled
- Performing maintenance or troubleshooting existing WSL installation

**When to Cancel**:

- WSL is working perfectly and no changes are needed
- You ran the script by mistake

### Common Issues

#### "git is not recognized" Error

**Problem**: Git is not installed or not in PATH
**Solutions**:

1. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Restart PowerShell** after Git installation
3. **Alternative**: Download ZIP directly from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract

#### "Script cannot be loaded" Error

**Problem**: PowerShell execution policy blocks script
**Solution**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### "Insufficient RAM" Error

**Problem**: System has less than 6GB RAM
**Solution**:

- üí° It's the right moment to request a new computer! üòÑ
- (Or you could try closing some memory-intensive applications, but where's the fun in that?)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Always run scripts as Administrator
- Ensure system restart after initial installation
- Keep Windows and WSL updated for best performance
- Review script contents before execution for security
