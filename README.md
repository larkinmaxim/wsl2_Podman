## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Folder and Clone Repository

1. **Create a folder for scripts**

   - Open **File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
   - Navigate to your desired location (e.g., C:\ drive or Desktop)
   - **Right-click** in empty space
   - Select **New** ‚Üí **Folder**
   - Name the folder `WSL-Scripts`
   - **Double-click** the folder to open it
2. **Open terminal in this folder and clone repository**

   - **Right-click** inside the `WSL-Scripts` folder
   - Select **"Open in Terminal"** or **"Open PowerShell window here"**
   - Run the git clone command:

   ```powershell
   git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman.git .
   ```

### Step 2: Run WSL Installation

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator** (see [Running PowerShell as Administrator](#-running-powershell-as-administrator) section below)
2. **Navigate to scripts folder**

   ```powershell
   cd C:\WSL-Scripts
   ```
3. **Run WSL installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\install-wsl.ps1
   ```

### Step 3: Restart Computer

**Restart your computer when prompted**

### Step 4: Complete Installation

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator again** (see [Running PowerShell as Administrator](#-running-powershell-as-administrator) section)

   ```powershell
   cd C:\WSL-Scripts
   ```
2. **Run post-installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\post-install-wsl.ps1
   ```
3. **Run Podman installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\install-podman.ps1
   ```

**‚úÖ Done! Your WSL2 and Podman environment is ready.**

## üîê Running PowerShell as Administrator

**IMPORTANT**: All installation scripts require Administrator privileges. Here's how to open PowerShell as Administrator:

### Method 2: Search Menu

1. **Press Windows key** and type `powershell`
2. **Right-click** on "Windows PowerShell" in search results
3. **Select "Run as Administrator"** (see image below)
4. **Click "Yes"** when prompted by UAC

*Example: Right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator"*

## üìñ Detailed Usage Instructions

### Script Execution Policies

If you encounter execution policy errors, temporarily allow script execution:

```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Temporarily allow local scripts (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# After installation, restore original policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Analysis & Validation

### install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

- Detects existing WSL installations and provides user choice
- Comprehensive system checks before installation
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- User-friendly colored output
- Safe restart handling with confirmation
- Follows PowerShell best practices

**‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations**:

- RAM requirement (6GB) might be restrictive for some users
- No CPU virtualization capability check

### post-install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths**:

- Thorough WSL installation verification
- Informative status reporting
- Helpful guidance for next steps
- Robust error handling

- Podman machine startup can take several minutes on first run

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WSL Detection Behavior

#### WSL Already Installed

**Scenario**: The installation script detects an existing WSL installation
**Behavior**:

- Script displays current WSL version information
- Prompts user with "Do you want to continue anyway? (Y/N)"
- **Y/Yes**: Continues with installation (useful for repairs, updates, or feature re-enablement)
- **N/No**: Safely exits without making changes

**When to Continue**:

- WSL features are partially installed or corrupted
- You want to ensure all required Windows features are properly enabled
- Performing maintenance or troubleshooting existing WSL installation

**When to Cancel**:

- WSL is working perfectly and no changes are needed
- You ran the script by mistake

### Common Issues

#### Administrator Permission Errors

**Problem**: Script fails with Administrator requirement messages
**Examples**:

```
The script cannot be run because it contains a "#requires" statement for running as Administrator
```

```
ERROR: This script must be run as Administrator!
```

**Solution**: See the complete [Running PowerShell as Administrator](#-running-powershell-as-administrator) section above for detailed instructions with visual guides.

#### "git is not recognized" Error

**Problem**: Git is not installed or not in PATH
**Solutions**:

1. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Restart PowerShell** after Git installation
3. **Alternative**: Download ZIP directly from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract

#### "Script cannot be loaded" Error

**Problem**: PowerShell execution policy blocks script
**Solution**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### "Insufficient RAM" Error

**Problem**: System has less than 6GB RAM
**Solution**:

- üí° It's the right moment to request a new computer! üòÑ
- (Or you could try closing some memory-intensive applications, but where's the fun in that?)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Always run scripts as Administrator
- Ensure system restart after initial installation
- Keep Windows and WSL updated for best performance
- Review script contents before execution for security
