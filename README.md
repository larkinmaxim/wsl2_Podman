## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Clone Repository

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**

   ```powershell
   # Right-click Start menu ‚Üí Windows PowerShell (Admin)
   ```

2. **Navigate to desired installation directory**

   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop"  # Or any directory you prefer
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman.git
   cd wsl2_Podman
   ```

### Step 2: Pre-Installation

1. Ensure you're running Windows 10 (2004+) or Windows 11
2. Close all important applications - Restart computer will be required at the end of this step!
3. Ensure stable internet connection

### Step 3: Run Installation Script

1. **In the same PowerShell (Administrator) session**

2. **Execute installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\install-wsl.ps1
   ```

3. **Follow prompts** and restart when requested

   - If WSL is already installed, the script will detect it and ask if you want to continue
   - You can choose to proceed anyway (useful for repairs/updates) or cancel safely

### Step 4: Post-Installation Setup

1. **After restart, open PowerShell as Administrator again**

2. **Navigate back to the repository directory**

   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Desktop\wsl2_Podman"  # Adjust path as needed
   ```

3. **Run post-installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\post-install-wsl.ps1
   ```

### Step 5: Podman Installation (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Keep PowerShell as Administrator open**
2. **Run Podman installation script**

   ```powershell
   .\install-podman.ps1
   ```
3. **Wait for complete installation** (may take several minutes)

   - Downloads latest Podman Desktop from GitHub
   - Installs Podman Desktop and CLI silently
   - Initializes and starts Podman machine
   - Runs test container to verify functionality
4. **Podman Desktop GUI** will be available in Start Menu after installation

## üìñ Detailed Usage Instructions

### Script Execution Policies

If you encounter execution policy errors, temporarily allow script execution:

```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Temporarily allow local scripts (run as Administrator)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# After installation, restore original policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Analysis & Validation

### install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

- Detects existing WSL installations and provides user choice
- Comprehensive system checks before installation
- Proper error handling with meaningful messages
- User-friendly colored output
- Safe restart handling with confirmation
- Follows PowerShell best practices

**‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations**:

- RAM requirement (6GB) might be restrictive for some users
- No CPU virtualization capability check

### post-install-wsl.ps1 Analysis

**‚úÖ Strengths**:

- Thorough WSL installation verification
- Informative status reporting
- Helpful guidance for next steps
- Robust error handling
- Automatic WSL updates

### install-podman.ps1 Analysis

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### WSL Detection Behavior

#### WSL Already Installed

**Scenario**: The installation script detects an existing WSL installation
**Behavior**:

- Script displays current WSL version information
- Prompts user with "Do you want to continue anyway? (Y/N)"
- **Y/Yes**: Continues with installation (useful for repairs, updates, or feature re-enablement)
- **N/No**: Safely exits without making changes

**When to Continue**:

- WSL features are partially installed or corrupted
- You want to ensure all required Windows features are properly enabled
- Performing maintenance or troubleshooting existing WSL installation

**When to Cancel**:

- WSL is working perfectly and no changes are needed
- You ran the script by mistake

### Common Issues

#### "git is not recognized" Error

**Problem**: Git is not installed or not in PATH
**Solutions**:
1. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. **Restart PowerShell** after Git installation
3. **Alternative**: Download ZIP directly from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/larkinmaxim/wsl2_Podman/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract

#### "Script cannot be loaded" Error

**Problem**: PowerShell execution policy blocks script
**Solution**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### "Insufficient RAM" Error

**Problem**: System has less than 6GB RAM
**Solution**:

- üí° It's the right moment to request a new computer! üòÑ
- (Or you could try closing some memory-intensive applications, but where's the fun in that?)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Always run scripts as Administrator
- Ensure system restart after initial installation
- Keep Windows and WSL updated for best performance
- Review script contents before execution for security
